	abstract = {Gamification of education is a developing approach for increasing learners’ motivation and engagement by incorporating game design elements in educational environments. With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed success of its application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field by focusing on empirical evidence rather than on potentialities, beliefs or preferences. Accordingly, it critically examines the advancement in gamifying education. The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers’ understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited. The review highlights the need for systematically designed studies and rigorously tested approaches confirming the educational benefits of gamification, if gamified learning is to become a recognized instructional approach.},

	abstract = {With the rising number of cyberattacks, such as ransomware attacks and cyber espionage, educating non-cybersecurity professionals to recognize threats has become more important than ever before. However, traditional training methods, such as phishing awareness campaigns, training videos and assessments have proven to be less effective over time. Therefore, it is time to rethink the approach on how to train cyber awareness. In this paper we suggest an alternative approach -- a serious game -- to educate awareness for common cyberattacks. While many serious games for cybersecurity education exist, all follow a very similar approach: showing people the effects of a cyber attack on their own system or company network. For example, one of the main tasks in these games is to sort out phishing mails. We developed and evaluated a new type of cybersecurity game: an attack simulator, which shows the entire setting from a different perspective. Instead of sorting out phishing mails the players should write phishing mails to trick potential victims and use other forms of cyberattacks. Our game explains the intention of each attack and shows the consequences of a successful attack. This way, we hope, players will get a better understanding on how to detect cyberattacks.},

Some 247 articles, research reports, and technical reports were located, from which 26 experiments were identified as having sufficient information for statistical meta-analysis. The major finding was that the use of simulators combined with aircraft training consistently produced improvements in training for jets compared to aircraft training only. Use of motion cuing added little to the training environments for jets. The average effectiveness of performance-paced training was greater than that for lock-step training. In general, training outcomes appear to be influenced considerably by the type of task and the amount and type of training given.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the
effect of simulator fidelity on procedure skill training through a review of
existing studies.

Methods
MEDLINE, OVID and
EMBASE databases were searched between January 1990 and January 2019. Search
terms included “simulator fidelity and comparison” and "low fidelity"
and "high fidelity" and “comparison” and “simulator”. Author
classification of low- and high-fidelity was used for non-laparoscopic
procedures. Laparoscopic simulators are classified using a proposed schema. All
included studies used a randomized methodology with two or more groups and were
written in English. Data was abstracted to a standard data sheet and critically
appraised from 17 eligible full papers.


Results
Of 17 studies,
eight were for laparoscopic and nine for other skill training. Studies employed
evaluation methodologies, including subjective and objective measures. The
evaluation was conducted once in 13/17 studies and before-after in 4/17.
Didactic training only or control groups were used in 5/17 studies, while 10/17
studies included two groups only. Skill acquisition and simulator fidelity were
different for the level of training in 1/17 studies. Simulation training was
followed by clinical evaluation or a live animal evaluation in 3/17 studies.
Low-fidelity training was not inferior to training with a high-fidelity
simulator in 15/17 studies.


Conclusions
Procedure
skill after training with low fidelity simulators was not inferior to skill
after training with high fidelity simulators in 15/17 studies. Some data
suggest that the effectiveness of different fidelity simulators depends on the
level of training of participants and requires further study.},

Despite its popularity, research on gamification has produced mixed results regarding student learning outcomes. This meta-analysis aims to synthesize the existing empirical evidence on the effectiveness of gamification as a tool for promoting teaching and learning in educational settings. Forty-one studies with 49 independent samples involving more than 5,071 participants were included in our analysis. Results from random effects models showed an overall significant large effect size (g = 0.822 [0.567 to 1.078]). The research performed the moderator analysis to scrutinize the effects of a number of factors on the relationship between gamification and student learning outcomes. The study uncovered significant moderating effects for user type, educational discipline, design principles for educational gamification, duration of “gameful” experience, and learning environment. However, measurement of student outcomes and publication type did not appear to have any significant moderating effect. Those findings hold important implications for improving and implementing gamification to promote teaching and learning in future research.},

	abstract = {Today, cybersecurity training is commonplace in both large companies and Small \& Medium Enterprise (SME). Nonetheless, the effectiveness of many of the current training offerings is put into question by reports of increasing successful cyber-attacks. While a number of models for developing Cybersecurity (CS) training frameworks for industrial personnel or general audience have been proposed, these models often lack consideration for humans aspects of learning (cognitive abilities, learning styles, meta-cognition among others) during development. Additionally, the success of a CS training program highly depends on its ability to engage participants. To develop a CS training framework that is able to motivate participants, we must consider individual-specific factors that can affect the result of training, besides establishing optimal training delivery methods and assessment. For this, in this work we propose a CS training framework based on a revised version of the ADDIE model and more recent research personalised learning theory. The Delphi method was used to both develop and validate our decisions during the development of the training framework model. The results of the decision of the Delphi method have later been compared to recommendations in the literature to create the finalised framework. This work presents two major distinctions from other CS training frameworks models described in the literature. First, the developed model is strongly based in learning theory foundations and takes into consideration differences in learning styles, cognitive abilities and metacognition of individuals, to offer tailored solutions optimized for each group of employees and single individual. Second, the use of the Delphi method and the involvement of experts stakeholders from various sides of academia and industry gave a wide insight into current needs and recommendations for CS training, as well as formal validation for the final development.},

Especially in an organisational setting, end-user behaviour plays an essential role in achieving a high level of cybersecurity. One way to improve end-user cybersecurity behaviour is through comprehensive training programmes. There are many contradictory statements and findings with regard to the optimal way to conduct a behavioural cybersecurity training. We conducted a systematic review to create a comprehensive overview of the methods used in cybersecurity training and their effectiveness in improving organisational cybersecurity behaviours. Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, ProQuest, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched and 16,771 papers were identified. After title, abstract and full text screenings were conducted, 142 relevant papers were included in our analysis. The analysis shows that the majority of studies report positive effects of training, regardless of the cybersecurity topic that was addressed or the training method that was employed. Game-based training methods were used most often. Most studies used a non-experimental design to test effectiveness, with pretest-posttest designs being the most frequent. Sample sizes were often small and many interventions were not tested on employees but other populations. Further findings with regard to intervention design, characteristics and evaluation are discussed.},

With the average cyber insurance claim rising from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020, there is a growing necessity for better cyber information sources, standardised databases, mandatory reporting and public awareness. This research analyses the extant academic and industry literature on cybersecurity and cyber risk management with a particular focus on data availability. From a preliminary search resulting in 5219 cyber peer-reviewed studies, the application of the systematic methodology resulted in 79 unique datasets. We posit that the lack of available data on cyber risk poses a serious problem for stakeholders seeking to tackle this issue. In particular, we identify a lacuna in open databases that undermine collective endeavours to better manage this set of risks. The resulting data evaluation and categorisation will support cybersecurity researchers and the insurance industry in their efforts to comprehend, metricise and manage cyber risks.},

	abstract = {The first line of defense against cyber threats and cyber crimes is to be aware and get ready, e.g., through cyber security training. Training can have two forms, the first is directed towards security professionals and aims at improving understanding of the latest threats and increasing skill levels in defending and mitigating against them. The second form of training, which used to attract less attention, aims at increasing cyber security awareness among non-security professionals and the general public. Conducting such training programs requires dedicated testbeds and infrastructures that help realizing and executing the training scenarios and provide a playground for the trainees. A cyber range is an environment that aims at providing such testbeds. The purpose of this paper is to study the concept of a cyber range, and provide a systematic literature review that covers unclassified cyber ranges and security testbeds. In this study we develop a taxonomy for cyber range systems and evaluate the current literature focusing on architecture and scenarios, but including also capabilities, roles, tools and evaluation criteria. The results of this study can be used as a baseline for future initiatives towards the development and evaluation of cyber ranges in accordance with existing best practices and lessons learned from contemporary research and developments.},

It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. Since the 1990s, this type of document has proliferated in business. Today, a business-to-business (B2B) white paper is closer to a marketing presentation, a form of content meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a certain product or viewpoint. That makes B2B white papers a type of grey literature.
The term originated in the 1920s to mean a type of position paper or industry report published by a department of the UK government.},

	abstract = {The cognitive dimensions framework is a broad-brush evaluation technique for interactive devices and for non-interactive notations. It sets out a small vocabulary of terms designed to capture the cognitively-relevant aspects of structure, and shows how they can be traded off against each other. The purpose of this paper is to propose the framework as an evaluation technique for visual programming environments. We apply it to two commercially-available dataflow languages (with further examples from other systems) and conclude that it is effective and insightful; other HCI-based evaluation techniques focus on different aspects and would make good complements. Insofar as the examples we used are representative, current VPLs are successful in achieving a good ‘closeness of match’, but designers need to consider the ‘viscosity’ (resistance to local change) and the ‘secondary notation’ (possibility of conveying extra meaning by choice of layout, colour, etc.).},

Effective simulation hinges on the ability of the learner to suspend disbelief. Participants must accept the otherwise unrealistic aspects of clinical simulation, and yet the concept of suspension of disbelief has not been fully explored in the field of nursing. What allows some simulation participants to fully believe or immerse themselves in simulation while others struggle to “pretend”? What are the determinants of a participants' ability to suspend disbelief during simulation-based learning activities? Factors that contribute to the learner's ability to suspend disbelief include fidelity, psychological safety, emotional buy-in, the fiction contract, and how learners assign meaning. Various other factors that enable or impede one's ability to immerse in simulation are considered yet need further exploration.},
